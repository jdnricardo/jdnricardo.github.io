			<h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
			<p class="about-me">
				I am a long-time practitioner of environmental studies. After completing my B.A. in Environmental Studies from Amherst College in 2015, I worked in environmental politics, doing organizing, fundraising, and data management and analytics. Returning to school, I earned a M.S. in Political Science from the University of Oregon in 2021 for a thesis in international relations and comparative politics, titled, <em>The Green Industrial Policy Index: How Should We Measure Variation in the 'Green' Content of States' Industrial Policies?</em> The project developed a conceptual model of industrial policymaking vis-a-vis the 'green' energy transition and applied it to cross-sectional panel data (from the International Energy Agency) to map states' variation in degree & type of 'green' industrial policy-making from 2000-2020. 
				<br><br>
				In Spring '23 I advanced to candidacy for a Ph.D. in Environmental Studies, Science, and Policy (& Political Science). My research interests include the <strong>energy transition</strong>, <strong>climate policy</strong>, and <strong>social movements</strong>. My dissertation project is (tentatively) titled <em>Full Green Ahead: New energy infrastructure, communities, & conflict.</em> It examines the political economy of the U.S. electricity grid, asking how community, state, non-state & social movement actors are co-creating -- and contesting -- various trajectories of the energy transition. The project specifically focuses on questions of 'When', 'Where', and 'Why' social conflict emerges in response to the proposal and construction of new energy infrastructure, as well as 'Whether' and 'How' this conflict might shape individual project outcomes as well as aggregate energy transition outcomes.
				<br><br>
				As I finish my dissertation, I am also looking to the future. I am pursuing academic positions, as well as positions outside of the academy, in governmental or non-profit political organizational spaces. I am also interested in freelance works in data management, analytics, and software development for political organizations, non-profits, and labor unions.
